We use some custom caches based on Azure Table Storage and disk shares, and you'll see how to set up ASP.NET Output Caching to use different solution caches. You'll learn how to add caching outside the solution with HTTP response headers so consumers of your website and API can cache solution resources locally, and reduce traffic to your servers. Finally, you'll learn how to analyze items to configure them for maximum cache effectiveness, how to control items in caches, and how to measure the performance improvements you get from caching.">Caching in the .NET Stack: Inside-Out</a>

Improved behavior often has the downside of breaking changes and this course explores the possible downside of these changes.

ASP.NET Ajax's browser-neutral client script library is easily integrated with existing Web applications (including ASP.NET 1.* and non-.NET sites), improving response times and enhancing UIs with DHTML and Javascript features that in the past would have taken enormous development efforts and extensive client-side knowledge. ASP.NET 2.0 applications can take advantage of ASP.NET Ajax's server-side features to further enhance their UIs, often through simple markup.

You will first learn some fundamentals about ASP.NET Web API services, REST, and OData. Then you will learn about OData query syntax and how to easily implement it in your services. Then you will learn how to define Entity Data Models to support the full OData navigation syntaxes, and add OData formatters to turn your services into fully compliant OData services.

If you have existing ASP.NET Web Services you are trying to support, you may have realized that it can be difficult to find good information about using them today. In this course you will learn the basics of ASP.NET Web Services and how to use them. We'll start off by talking about the technology and learning about how ASP.NET Web Services work. Then, we'll dive in and create our own simple ASP.NET Web Service and learn about how the technology works. Once we have a web service built, we'll learn how to use .NET's proxy generating utilities to create a consumer for our web service without writing much code. After that, we'll learn how to use ASP.NET Web Service in an existing ASP.NET application to provide AJAX functionality and even see how we can embed service methods in ASPX page. Finally, in the last module, I'll take you through the process of converting a legacy ASP.NET Web Service to newer technologies like WCF and Web API. So, if you need to maintain an existing legacy ASP.NET Web Service application or you are looking to learn enough about ASP.NET Web Service to feel confident in migrating to a newer technology, you'll want to check out this course.">Introduction to ASP.NET Web Services</a>

Glimpse lets you see diagnostics information about what is happening on your server directly in your page through a small diagnostics window completely rendered in JavaScript. Out of the box, Glimpse can show you all kinds of information about your MVC application, like what routes are registered, what the flow was through the MVC pipeline and how the models were bound. In this course I walk you through getting Glimpse set up in your application. Then, I show you how to use the Glimpse tabs to understand what is going on in your ASP.NET application. After that, I'll take you through the very useful ASP.NET MVC tabs and show you how to diagnose a real problem in an ASP.NET MVC 4 application using glimpse. Once we learn all about Glimpse, it's time to learn about plugins. In the last two modules of the course, I first show you how to install and use some of the common Glimpse plugins, then I show you how easy it is to actually create your own Glimpse plugin. So, if you are an ASP.NET developer and you haven't heard of Glimpse, you'll definitely want to check out this course. It will be well worth your time. And if you have heard about Glimpse, but haven't felt like you have had the time to learn how to use it, this course will help you to become a Glimpse expert and learn everything you need to know to start using Glimpse in just a few hours.">Using Glimpse With ASP.NET, MVC4, and Entity Framework</a>

In this course, you will learn the basics of Java and Android while you create a real working Android application. This course is the third course in a 4 part series on beginning Android development, but you don't need to watch the other courses to understand this one. As long as you have some basic programming knowledge, you should be able to follow along with this course and build your first Android application using Java and Eclipse. In this course we'll alternate between learning and doing as we set out to build a note taking application for Android. We'll start off covering everything you need to know about getting setup to develop an Android application in Java using Eclipse. Then we'll create our Note Taker application step by step, clearly explaining each step as we go and introducing Java concepts along the way. If you are looking for a new and fun way to learn Java while building an Android application, or you are just looking to maximize your time, by learning two topics at the same time, this course might be just what you are looking for.">Android Beginner Series: Just Enough Java</a>

Perhaps you are brand new to the world of programming and want to learn how to program quickly while doing something fun like developing an Android app? If so, this brand new course series might be just what you are looking for. This is the first course in a series of 4 courses designed to take you from knowing nothing about Android and very little about programming in general to building your own Android apps and games. Here is a breakdown of the courses: course 1: Understanding Android - this course; course 2: Creating Android Apps Without Code Using App Inventor; course 3: Just Enough Java To Build An Android App; course 4: Building a Simple Game In Android. In this first course, we take a look at the very basics of Android and learn exactly what Android is and how it works. This course will go over the design and history of Android. Then we'll take a look at what exactly an operating system is so that we can better understand the Android operating system and how it works. After that we'll go over Android applications and exactly what makes them unique. And we'll finish up the course by talking about all the different ways you can develop Android applications and how the Android app markets work. By the time you finish this course, you should have a solid foundation in Android fundamentals and be ready to start learning how to develop Android applications in the upcoming courses in this series. Whatever your level of programming experience, this course series will get you building your own apps and games in Android quickly, and we'll have fun doing it. And even if you are already an Android developer, you may find the in depth understanding of how Android works that you will learn from this course valuable.">Android Beginner Series: Understanding Android</a>

Along the way, you'll learn some basic programming concepts that will help you gain the skills you need to be able to program in a language like Java. We'll start off by learning about App Inventor and how to get it setup. Next, we'll jump right in and create the follow four real applications: (1) a number guessing game; (2) a simple drawing program; (3) an RPG character creator; (4) Irritated Dolphins (our Angry Birds-like game). If you are looking to get started with Android programming, or programming in general, this course will offer you a gentle introduction to many Android and basic programming concepts and make it fun and easy to learn. And if you are already an experienced developer, but are interested in checking out App Inventor, you'll probably find this course useful and fun as well. This course is the 2nd course in a four part series on beginner Android development, where we go from not knowing how to code to building real Android application in Java.">Learning to Build Apps with App Inventor</a>

It offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages don’t have. You can use C++ to write different kinds of applications for a variety of platforms. In this course, I’ll cover basics of language syntax – declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions – and work up to templates, pointers, const, and polymorphism. I’ll be using the principles of “modern C++” as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management.

In this sequel to C++ Fundamentals, you'll learn those things. A quick overview of the Standard Library will provide you with collections, algorithms to work with collections, and string manipulation capabilities, as well as signposts to more Standard Library capabilities. Then perhaps the most important C++11 language change, lambdas, are explained and put in context. Finally exceptions, a powerful error-handling technique, are introduced and you will see their significance for resource and memory management. With the modern C++ foundations complete, the last module of this course goes back in time to the sorts of syntax and idioms you're likely to find in older code, including typedefs, function pointers, void pointers, and C-style strings and arrays. Modern C++ developers must cope with legacy code and this module will show you how.">C++ Fundamentals - Part 2</a>

When you need a job, it is important to have good job interviewing skills and know what to expect. The only problem is, it is very difficult to get experience with job interviews, because we don't do them that often. This course is designed to make you feel much more prepared for a developer job interview by going over the process and talking about many of the types of questions you are likely to encounter. In this course we'll go over the basics of a job interview and talk about specifically what employers are looking for and how you can improve your resume. I'll teach you some tricks that increase the chances of you getting an interview greatly. We'll also go over one of the most difficult and scary parts of a developer job interview, solving a coding question on the spot. I'll walk you through my own personal technique for solving these types of problem and take you step by step through an example, so that you can gain the skills and experience that will help you feel comfortable to tackle these kinds of problems on your own. Our journey will then takes us through some typical interview questions to help you understand what types of thing you should know and prepare for and the best way to answer these types of questions. Then we'll go through a blazing fast boot camp for computer science questions about data structures, algorithms, bit manipulation, and concurrency... All the fun stuff you forgot about from college. And finally we'll wrap up by talking about how you can get experience if you don't have any, and what kind of experience is valuable. If you are looking for a job currently or just want to brush up on your skills to be prepared, this course might be just for you.">Preparing For a Job Interview</a>

What about setting breakpoints that automatically trigger whenever an AJAX call is made, or whenever a specific element on a page is modified? You can do all this and more with the Chrome Developer Tools, and in this course I'll show you how. If you've seen the Chrome Developer Tools, but just not had the time to really dig into them, or you get the feeling that you are only scratching the surface of what the Chrome Developer Tools can do, this course might be exactly what you need to take your web development abilities to the next level. I've found that many web developers are only aware of the basic features of the Chrome Developer Tools, so I've structured this course to go over just about every inch of the tools and explain clearly what they do and how you can use them. In this course we'll cover every one of the 8 panels that exist in the Chrome Developer Tools toolbar. We'll start off by going over the function of the console, giving you the ability to modify JavaScript objects interactively on the page, debug issues and add helpful log messages with ease. Then, we'll take a trip to the elements panel where we'll be seeing how to modify HTML and CSS styles and see the effects immediately displayed on the page. After that, we'll check out the network panel and how to find out exactly what resources our pages are getting from the network, how long it is taking to get them, and what order all of this is happening in. Then, we'll head over to the sources panel and unveil the powerful built-in JavaScript debugging capabilities that Chrome has out of the box. (You won't want to miss this part.) We'll follow up with a quick review of the audits panel to see how it can give us some handy optimization tips for our pages. Then we'll dig into the timeline panel where we'll learn how to figure out exactly what is happening when a page is being displayed and how to optimize our pages to ensure the animation is never choppy. Finally, we'll wrap things up by seeing how the profiles panel can help us quickly identify performance problems with JavaScript or CSS selectors and also let us see into the scary realm of JavaScript memory management. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to really dig into the Chrome Developer Tools and see what all they can do, that time has come!">Using The Chrome Developer Tools</a>

If you are tired of seeing try/catch blocks and logging statements all throughout your exception handling code, this course will help you clean up that code! In this course we will learn how to use the Microsoft Enterprise Library's Exception Handling Application Block. We start off by learning a bit about the block and some common exception handling strategies. We will also learn how to configure the Exception Handling Block, and how to use it for common exception handling strategies such as wrapping, replacing and logging. Finally, we will cover using the block in a WCF application and learn how to create custom Exception Handlers.">Enterprise Library Exception Handling Application Block</a>

The course begins by explaining why it is so important to choose server hardware for SQL Server 2012 correctly, and then explains how to categorize your workload and the hardware requirements of the common SQL Server workloads. It then explains how to choose a processor based on your server configuration, as well as how to compare the performance of processors, as well as the various SQL Server 2012 Editions and their license limits. Next it explains the various storage types, RAID levels, and how to test the performance of your storage, along with comparing overall server performance and considerations around the amount of memory to use. Finally it discusses the effects on hardware choice of high-availability and disaster-recovery strategies, along with hot-swappable components to increase uptime. This course is perfect for anyone who is purchasing hardware for SQL Server for the first time and needs guidance on how to properly make decisions to get the return on investment from SQL Server 2012 license costs and server hardware and storage costs.">SQL Server 2012: Evaluating and Sizing Hardware</a>

How can you avoid having to pay exorbitant amounts for licenses, or wasting money through over-provisioning a server? This course answers all these questions and more. The course begins be explaining basic server terminology, and then explains how to decode Dell and HP server model numbers, along with Intel and AMD processor numbers so you can figure out what current servers and components you have. It then describes and demonstrates the common application, processor, memory, and disk benchmarks you can use to evaluate the performance of your current and new servers. After that, it explains all the choices you need to make when choosing a new server so that you make the best use of your hardware budget, considering the anticipated workload plus OS and application licensing limitations. Finally it covers how to maintain your servers, including how to limit maintenance downtime using high-availability technology, and then how to maximize your hardware budget through negotiation tactics, consolidation, and virtualization. This course is perfect for beginners with little knowledge of server hardware, through developers, DBAs, managers, and other IT professionals who need to understand how to successfully evaluate and provision new servers">Understanding Server Hardware</a>

Wouldn't it be awesome if you could write your own Kinect enabled applications to take advantage of this awesome piece of technology? In this course I'll walk you through the creation of a real application using the Kinect. We'll be building a Fruit Ninja clone called Shape Ninja which will be capable of detecting chopping gestures and responding to audio commands. We'll start off by learning a little bit about the Kinect itself and the Kinect SDK. Then, I'll show you just how easy it is to get color image and depth data from the Kinect. We'll make our application be able to detect and respond to a chopping gesture. And, we'll wrap things up by learning how to use the Microsoft Speech Platform SDK in combination with the Kinect's audio sensors to implement real voice commands for our application. If you've been waiting for the opportunity to check out the Kinect, but you didn't know where to start or perhaps you thought it would be difficult to learn, this course will get you up and running with the Kinect in no time.">Building a Real Application With Kinect</a>

Great new diagnostic features provide the ability to save information about failed requests and allow inspection of worker processes and active requests running in the web server.

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/hibernate-introduction" title="In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I'll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we'll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you've learned how to map you objects, you'll want to know how to query them, so I'll show you how to do this using Hibernate's built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we'll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you've been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.">Introduction To Hibernate</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/java-jvm-dotnet-interop" title="Are you plagued by the problem of trying to get some Java and C# code to work together? Do you have constant battles between the .NET side and the Java side, because of the competition between the two? Perhaps you just have to work in both environments and wish there was a way to reuse some of your code from Java in .NET or .NET code in Java? This course will give you solutions to help with all of those problems. In this course we'll take a look at how you can make your Java and .NET code talk by utilizing 3 different technologies. First, we'll use IKVM.NET to convert Java directly to .NET, which will allow you to use Java libraries in your .NET applications and even write Java applications in .NET. Then, we'll use JNBridgePro to bridge directly between .NET and Java and allow you to communicate between .NET and Java applications while still running each in their own environment. Finally, I'll introduce you to RabbitMQ for creating a message based service that allows for not only Java and .NET to interoperate, but also any other language that can send messages to RabbitMQ. So, if you've been considering rewrite a Java application as a .NET application or a .NET application as a Java application, but have been thinking there has to be a better way, this course might be just what you are looking for. Or if you are in an environment where both Java and .NET are used, but seldom talk to each other, this course can help you to learn about tools you can use to get both sides talking, letting you walk away a hero.">Making Java And C# Work Together: JVM and .NET CLR Interop</a>

Learn to leverage jQuery to move beyond simply selecting and manipulating DOM nodes. Some of the many topics covered include: authoring plugins for internal projects and for publication, improving performance of DOM node selection and insertion, customizing jQuery to add more defaults and named constants, using the data method to store and retrieve arbitrary data associated with DOM nodes, manipulating arrays and collections with jQuery's built-in utility methods, and handling events correctly even for dynamically created DOM nodes. This course also includes a comprehensive coverage of deferred objects and promises based on CommonJS. Code examples are given for most of the covered concepts.">jQuery Advanced Topics</a>

Even though there are many solutions today for cross platform development on these platforms, many of the solutions either require you to use a single non-native user interface or create your user interface code multiple times. Appcelerator Titanium is an exciting way to build truly native Android and iOS applications using JavaScript which are able to reuse a large amount of code, even for the user interface. In this course, I'll take you through the process of getting setup with Appcelerator Titanium and fill you in on all the details of how exactly Titanium works and why it is so different than many other cross platform solutions. Throughout this course, we'll actually build a real mobile application that will run on both Android and iOS using Appcelerator Titanium and along the way learn about the platform and how to use it. We'll start off learning how to programmatically create a cross platform user interface in JavaScript and how to interact with the user interface and respond to events like button clicks. Then, we'll learn a bit about the different platform APIs that Titanium provides and how to expand our app to take into account multiple screens. After that, we'll learn about Alloy, a way to build Titanium applications using XML markup and style sheets using an MVC or Model View Controller approach, which can greatly simplify our code and make it much easier to design an application. Finally, in the last module, we'll tackle a few advanced concepts and learn about the awesome Titanium Cloud API, which allows us to create a full backend for our application without having to install any databases or design any complex schemas. So, if you are interested in cross platform application development and you'd like to see how you can build truly cross platform native applications using JavaScript, you'll definitely want to check out this course.">Cross Platform Android and iOS Apps With Appcelerator Titanium</a>

We then examine Node's module system, including built-in modules, application modularization as well as the NPM third party module registry. From there we tackle EventEmitters and Streams, as well as utilities for interacting with the local file system. Next we look at using Node to write both client and server web applications, as well as real time integration with Socket.IO. We cover writing unit tests using both the built-in assert module and third party frameworks. We wrap up with a look at launching child processes in Node and writing scalable applications with the &quot;cluster&quot; module.">Introduction to Node.js</a>

A lot of developers find Redis is very different than relational databases like SQL Server or Oracle and even quite different than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB or RavenDB. In this course, you will begin to understand exactly what Redis is and how Redis works. You will walk through 5 data structures of Redis that will help you to understand how each data structure works and when you might use it. John will show you how to install Redis, both on a Windows machine for learning and testing and on a real Linux server for production use. You'll also learn about the ServiceStack.Redis C# client for accessing Redis from C# code. Finally, John will take you through the process of creating a real application with Redis and ASP.NET MVC4 as we put what we learned into practice. The purpose of this course is to take you from being hesitant to learning this database, to confident in building a complete application using Redis as a backend.">Building NoSQL Apps With Redis</a>

Each module of the course presents applied and practical uses of PowerShell to the everyday life of a software developer. You will be introduced to PowerShell, shown how to automate things you do in Windows Explorer, and how to leverage all of your .NET knowledge from the interactive PowerShell console. Then you will learn how to effectively use legacy console applications, how to customize the PowerShell environment. You’ll gain knowledge of how to use a multitude of third-party PowerShell modules and how to tame your software builds using the PSake PowerShell Module. You will finish off the course by looking at StudioShell.">Everyday PowerShell for Developers</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/introduction-building-web-applications-dart" title="Dart is an exciting new programming language from Google which is designed to eventually replace JavaScript. Dart is an optionally typed language, meaning that it can be as dynamic as JavaScript, but it also has a type system which can give you the benefits of languages like C# and Java. In fact, you'll find that if you already know Java or C#, Dart will seem very familiar to you, since it takes some of the best features of those languages and much of their syntax. Many C# and Java developers find they can start writing Dart code with a very short learning curve. You'll also find that you can start using Dart right now, because Dart code can compile down to standard JavaScript which can run anywhere. In this course, I'll take you through Dart and the Dart platform, and show you the basics of the language. We'll quickly go over the language itself in a single module and then we'll jump right in to building a real web application with Dart and the Dart libraries. You'll learn how to add Dart code to a web page in a very similar fashion that you probably have been doing with JavaScript. You'll also see the power of the Dart language and libraries as we explore some of the advanced data binding and templating features in the Dart Web UI library. We'll wrap up the course by going over some of the advanced features of Dart, like concurrency using isolates instead of threads, and mixins that allow us to get the benefits of inheritance without many of the drawbacks. So, if you've been interested in Dart, but haven't wanted to invest the time into learning a whole new programming language, this course will show you how much about the Dart language you probably already know and get you building a real application quickly. The goal of this course is to make it as easy and painless as possible to get started with Dart and decide if it is something you want to learn more about.">Introduction To Building Web Applications With Dart</a>

As machine learning is a very vast area, this course will be targeted more towards one of the machine learning methods which is neural networks. The course will try to make a base foundation first by explaining machine learning through some real world applications and various associated components. In this course, we'll take one of the open source machine learning framework for .NET, which is ENCOG. The course will explain how ENCOG fits into the picture for machine learning programming. Then we'll learn to create various neural network components using ENCOG and how to combine these components for real world scenarios. We'll go in detail of feed forward networks and various propagation training methodologies supported in ENCOG. We'll also talk about data preparation for neural networks using normalization process. Finally, we will take a few more case studies and will try to implement tasks of classification &amp; regression. In the course I will also give some tips &amp; tricks for effective &amp; quick implementations of neural networks in real world applications.">Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3</a>

The Go Programming Language is a new programming language from Google. It is very different than many other modern programming languages, and is a great substitute for C or C++. In this course we will cover most of the Go programming language and look at some of the neat things we can do with Go. We'll progressively cover each important concept in the language and finally end by looking at concurrency (which is built into the language.) If you are looking for an extremely fast an efficient language that is an elegant replacement for traditional systems programming languages like C or C++, Go might be just what you are looking for. Go allows you many of the benefits of powerful low level languages, but is very easy to use and designed with today's programming environment in mind. By the end of this course you should be ready to start programming in Go!">The Go Programming Language</a>

Most of the pages you see in a typical SharePoint site have one or more web parts on them. Needless to say, developing custom web parts is one of the more common tasks given to a SharePoint developer and likely how they were introduced to SharePoint development in the first place. This course examines web part development from asking, “What are web parts?” to looking at how to connect two web parts using ASP.NET Ajax. Whether you are new to building web parts or you have some experience under your belt, you’ll find tips and techniques in this course to help you become a more effective web part developer.">SharePoint 2010 Web Part Development</a>

Next, you'll discover what's new when it comes to using PowerShell V3 with SharePoint 2013. Administering SharePoint with PowerShell does not mean that you're limited to what you can do directly on the server, and in this course you'll learn everything you need to know to manage your Farm remotely, whether you are using Office 365 or an on-premises installation. And finally, sometimes the out of the box cmdlets just aren't enough - so we'll teach you how to create your own custom cmdlets that you can deploy to your SharePoint Farm.

Not only has the mobile revolution brought us amazing power, but also a consumer grade computing environment for all. As we go to build such solutions, we have found people quickly come to the big question: Web, or native app? In this course we will try to tear apart that question and get to the nuance that lies within.We will use computing history to learn from past mistakes and triumphs. We will then look into the advantages and flaws of the technology behind the Web and native platforms. We quickly bisect the fact that there are two sides to the question: Using the Web as a delivery platform? Or, as an experience platform? At Walmart Labs we have gone through these challenges, so we use our own example to add to other case studies to give an overview of the problem and how you can hope to use the Web and native together more as peanut butter and jelly.">Web vs Apps: The Big Picture</a>

This course will dive into the problem with estimation in projects today and then a complete overview of the concept of agile estimation and the notion of re-estimation. We’ll learn about user stories, story points, planning poker , product backlog, team velocity, how to apply them all to estimation and iterative re-estimation. We will then take an alternative approach and look at using real metrics to limit the guesswork in estimating and still run a team that produces predictably and reliably. The course will round out with a discussion on how to “sell” the concept of Agile Estimation in various environments such as consulting or fixed cost projects. Upon completion of this course you will be able to perform Agile Estimation in your organization.">Agile Estimation</a>

This course is a great way to introduce Agile Software Development practices to your team or organization. In addition to learning Scrum, students learn effective techniques for managing Agile teams and projects. Students and teams come away with a solid foundation to begin executing their first Scrum Sprint. This online material is offered here primarily as reference material for customers who have already taken the instructor-led version of this course.

This course is about how you could hold regular &quot;Coding Dojo&quot; meetings where you and your team can focus on improving your practical coding skills together. You'll be practicing in a safe, collaborative environment, using simple &quot;Code Kata&quot; examples. It becomes a space away from your normal work, where you can discuss coding practices like Test Driven Development and Refactoring, then later bring your new skills to bear in your production code. This course should give you; the coding dojo organizer, the supporting materials you need to start a Coding Dojo, and get everyone who attends to practice better software development techniques. It should also allow you to improve your communication and facilitation skills, and help your team to gel. Kent Beck once said &quot;I'm not a great programmer, I'm just a good programmer with great habits&quot;. What are you doing to improve your coding habits?

Many times some of what needs to be tested and how it needs to be tested gets lost in the translation. Wouldn't it be easier if the business person or QA person could just create the test cases themselves and still have them automated? FitNesse is a great testing framework that allows you to do just that. Using FitNesse, a developer creates test fixtures that allow non-technical people to write tests just by modifying a Wiki page. In this course I'll walk you through the steps to get set up and running with FitNesse. I'll show you how to use the older Fit style of creating test and the newer Slim style and we'll cover both Java and .NET, since FitNesse can work with either platform. FitNesse itself happens to be a Wiki, so it is also an excellent tool for documenting a system and the tests that go with it in a format that changes with the system. So if you've been thinking about learning about an acceptance test framework, or you've been wanted to learn FitNesse, but have always thought it had a steep learning curve, this course will help you to get started quickly and understand how FitNesse works.">Creating Acceptance Tests With FitNesse</a>

Perhaps you already know a little about JUnit, but you've always wanted to learn more about this useful framework? Either way, this course will teach you what you need to know to not only get started with JUnit, but to master all of the features of the JUnit framework. In this course, we'll start out by learning the basics of JUnit and how to create some basic unit tests. Then, we'll go into some of the lesser known advanced features of JUnit that will really help you write elegant tests with less code. After that, I'll show you how to integrate JUnit with your existing Ant or Maven build system and how you can automate the creation of JUnit reports. Finally, we'll wrap things up by going beyond the basic uses of JUnit by learning how to use stubs and mocks to really isolate classes and we'll also learn how to use JUnit for more than just unit testing. By the end of this course, you'll be a JUnit pro and will have a handful of useful tools and techniques you can use to make the most of the JUnit framework. If you are interested in JUnit, you won't want to miss this course.">Unit Testing In Java With JUnit</a>

How do you choose a RAID level for the SQL Server storage? Which installation options should you choose for SQL Server, and how do you keep SQL Server up-to-date after installing it? This course answers all these questions and more. The course begins by explaining why it is so important to install SQL Server 2012 correctly, and then explains how to configure Windows for stability and performance, choose a storage RAID level that takes the anticipated SQL Server workload into account, and test the storage to ensure it has the performance required. It then describes and shows the SQL Server 2012 installation process, including which options to choose or not, along with common configuration mistakes to avoid. After that it explains how to keep your SQL Server 2012 instance up-to-date with Service Packs and Cumulative Updates, as well as post-installation configuration tasks such as provisioning tempdb. Finally it explains how to configure Database Mail and SQL Server Agent Alerts so that you are notified of critical errors when they occur, plus installing and configuring a simple solution for regular database maintenance, such as backups and index rebuilds. This course is perfect for anyone who is installing SQL Server for the first time and needs guidance on how to properly configure Windows, SQL Server, storage, and regular maintenance so that the SQL Server installation is stable, performs well, and adheres to configuration best practices.">SQL Server 2012: Installation and Configuration</a>

It's critical that your application performs well under load, keeps the user data secure, and is able to be installed and upgraded easily. This course explains all these considerations using a layered approach that ties into stages in the development lifecycle. The course begins by examining database design and schema considerations, plus general best practices around security using roles, logins, and users. It then explains and demonstrates numerous aspects of T-SQL coding where choices can be made to make the code and application more efficient, and avoid common performance pitfalls. Application and code testing is then addressed, along with figuring out the hardware, software, and SQL Server requirements that must be communicated to the users. The course ends by walking through the deployment phase, including common SQL Server and database configuration options that must be changed or left as the default value, and explaining how to ensure that application and database upgrades run smoothly.

The course follows a building-blocks approach, starting with a simple definition and example of how logging is used, and then covering transaction log architecture and log recorss themselves. Using this knowledge, the course then moves into details of checkpoint operations, general transaction log operations including log clearing and VLF management, and how recovery and crash recovery work. The three recovery models are described in detail, as well as how to create and configure transaction logs for optimal performance, including monitoring transaction log performance. The course ends with a detailed module on transaction log backups, tail-of-the-log-backups, and examining transaction log contents, and then a module on dealing with transaction log corruption and how logging and recovery are used in high-availability technologies.

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/sqlserver-tqpq" title="There are many problems that can lower the performance of your workload and one of the most common is an incorrect query plan. Often the poor query plan is chosen because the cardinality estimate is wrong - the estimate by the query processor of how many table rows will be involved in the query. This course shows you how to recognize when the query processor has an incorrect estimate, along with explaining and showing a multitude of possible causes, plus how to fix them. The course starts with explaining why query plan quality is important, and then shows how to easily spot cardinality estimate issues from examining query plans. The majority of the course shows all the possible causes of cardinality estimates being incorrect along with how to fix them, and more than 25 demos to walk you through practical examples of the concepts and problems in the lectures. This course is perfect for developers, DBAs, and anyone responsible for performance tuning on SQL Server. The information in the course applies to all version from SQL Server 2005 onwards.">SQL Server: Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues</a>

This course will show you how to properly configure, control, and monitor VMware and Hyper-V virtual machines being used for SQL Server instances, and how to troubleshoot and fix common performance problems caused by virtualization issues. The course begins by explaining how virtualization works under the covers and why virtualization has become so popular. It then discusses the various memory, CPU, and storage considerations that must be taken into account when virtualizing SQL Server, and demonstrates how to properly configure virtual machines for use with SQL Server. Next the course discusses the high availability and disaster recovery options that VMware and Hyper-V provide, plus how to back up virtual machines. Finally the course shows how to monitor and improve virtual machine guest and host performance in VMware and Hyper-V, and discusses some of the limitations that could prevent a SQL Server workload from being successfully virtualized.

Almost all the tricks in Visual Studio 2010 work in Visual Studio 2012 as well, and many also work in previous versions of Visual Studio. You'll learn how to leverage IntelliSense and more efficiently edit code. You'll see a boatload of keystrokes in the context of getting things done. Find and Replace has some of the most underutilized features of Visual Studio and you'll learn how to speed up simple searches by avoiding the Find dialog, nuances of exploring symbols, and Regular Expression for find and replace.">Visual Studio 2010 Tricks</a>

Originally code named &quot;Data Dude&quot;, Visual Studio Database Projects havef gone through several name changes since it's inception with VS 2005. In Visual Studio 2010 it became another project type, a Database Project. In this series you will learn how to harness the power of the Database Project to create a new database, or reverse engineer the code for an existing database. You will learn how to refactor, and let Visual Studio keep track of the changes, to let it automatically generate change and deployment scripts. Finally, you'll learn how to take advantage of Visual Studio's powerful data generation capabilities to create realistic test data.">Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects</a>

Moreover, an easier task is to transaction-enable .NET applications. .NET provides you with the classes to do just that. If that is the case, then why a course about transactions? Well, that is because just like everything else in programming, you need to understand the architecture, the underground of whatever seems to be an easy task. Only then can you design solutions as opposed to only coding them. WCF transactions are built from ground up around .NET transactions. This is hardly surprising anyway, since WCF is a .NET technology. However, this sums up as follows: you need to understand how .NET does transactions in order to utilize them in WCF.">Understanding .NET and WCF Transactions</a>

To achieve this, you need to design your application following principles of separation of concerns and loose coupling, which usually means employing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in XAML. In addition, you have to learn how to leverage the new features of the Windows Runtime (WinRT) platform to ensure a great user experience, but have the code that drives that experience in the right places in your application following the MVVM pattern. In this course you will learn how to do that by learning how to leverage the Microsoft patterns and practices guidance &quot;Prism for Windows Runtime&quot; directly from a member of the Prism team. You will learn how to separate your Pages into Views and ViewModels following the MVVM pattern and integrate nicely with the WinRT navigation system and application lifecycle of suspend/terminate/resume. You'll learn how to manage dependencies and communicate between loosely coupled components in your application. You will see how to validate user input, both on the client side and through service calls to a back end, as well as how to display those errors to the user. You learn how to call Web API services and how to do simple authentication and authorization with those services. Finally you will learn how to leverage Windows Runtime platform features including Search charm, Settings charm flyout panels, and Live Tiles.">Building Windows Store Business Apps with Prism</a>

Traditionally, app data has been local, but Metro blurs the distinction between local and remote data by making things such as cloud storage and app-to-app integration an integral part of both the user and developer experiences. This course looks at accessing files, local and remote, as a content source for our apps; it explores app data storage and roaming as well as the settings contract; and it takes an in-depth look at app-to-app sharing through the sharing contract. Before doing so, however, it starts with a fresh look at the UI side of things, including Metro controls and data binding. After watching this course, you should feel comfortable accessing, listing, updating, roaming and sharing data in your metro apps.">Windows 8 Metro Application Data</a>

Accessing the Windows Azure platform from Windows Phone applications makes for unlimited possibilities for developers. However, working with Azure from a device comes with challenges, such as dealing with HTTP-based communication and access control. The Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone was created by people from Microsoft to simplify make mobile cloud scenarios for Windows Phone developers, through a set of services and tools that greatly facilitate performing common tasks involved in working with Azure tables, blobs and queues. This course, takes an in-depth and hands-on look at leveraging Azure storage services from a Windows Phone application, by exploring and building on top of the toolkit. Along the way, we introduce each of the Azure storage types, and we learn about the programming interfaces they expose and how to work with them directly and through the toolkit’s architecture.">Building Windows Phone Applications with Azure</a>
